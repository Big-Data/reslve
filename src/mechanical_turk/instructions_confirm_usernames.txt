Instructions for Turkers:
You will be presented with 12 questions that ask you to look up information about Wikipedia and Twitter users. Your goal is to determine whether a username that exists on both Wikipedia and Twitter actually belongs to the same single individual or to two different people. You can determine this by visiting a user's Wikipedia user page and visiting a user's Twitter profile and looking for matching information such as real name, email, occupation, photo, or location.
A Wikipedia user page has a URL of the form http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:username   For example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales
A Twitter user's profile has a URL of the form http://en.twitter.com/username. For example: http://en.twitter.com/kevinthau
